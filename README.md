# Selenium Test Repo

## What is this?

Test repository to fiddle with Selenium.

### What are you currently testing?

Google
1. Searching text by entering/clicking will result in a redirect to the correct search URL

### Design Philosophies
1. Abstract direct selenium calls to isolate updates to selenium syntax, features, and specifications. (Base Page Object)
2. Abstract data that is presented on the page. (Page Object)
3. Creation of tests that utilize the current Page Object.
